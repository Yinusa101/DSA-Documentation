This is where I started building my portfolio while taking my data analysis class with Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from MS excel , MS SQL and now Portforlio building.

## Project Topic : E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into sales perfomance of the E commerce project
over the past year . By analysing the various parameters in the datat received we seek enough insight
to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from 
the insight gotten and to know the best perfomance from our data 

### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Data Sales.csv and this is an open source data that can 
be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle or FRED or any other data repository 
site.

### Data Cleaning and preparation

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following 
actions ;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables 
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such 
as;
- What is the overall sales trend
-  Which product are top sellers
-   What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis

This is where we include some basic lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX
expressions used during analysis 

```  SQL
SELECT A,B,C
Where A> 15
```
